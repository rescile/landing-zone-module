This module defines a foundation for resource deployments with rescile UCS. The module provides a standardized building block that lays the ground for provider specific infrastructure modules to construct complete hybrid-cloud environment. It creates and configures a foundation for a managed infrastructure target for subsequent resource deployments.

## Rescile UCS

The module serves as  part of the **Rescile UCS infrastructure ecosystem**. Rescile UCS acts as the provisioning and orchestration environment. It maintains the infrastructure model, resolves dependencies and drives the execution of infrastructure changes. The relationship can be summarized as:

```

UCS provides the common control plane, while individual modules describe the infrastructure resources that can be provisioned. This separation allows modules to remain focused on **what infrastructure should exist**, while UCS manages **how infrastructure is modeled, related and provisioned**. For more information, see the [Rescile UCS project](https://www.rescile.com/).

Instead of configuring core networking, identity, and governance manually in every new environment, a landing zone template uses Infrastructure as Code (IaC)—typically leveraging tools like Terraform, OpenTofu, Ansible, or declarative controllers—to enforce a consistent operational baseline.

## Core Components

The landing zone module codifies and automates five essential pillars:

* **Identity & Access Management (IAM):** Centralized directory integration (Active Directory, Okta, OIDC/SAML), role-based access control (RBAC), privilege management, and unified identity federation across public and private domains.
* **Hybrid Networking & Connectivity:** Automated provisioning of multi-cloud network fabrics, including site-to-site VPNs, dedicated private lines (AWS Direct Connect, Azure ExpressRoute, Megaport), BGP routing, transit gateways, IPAM (IP Address Management), and firewall transit hubs.
* **Security & Compliance Guardrails:** Pre-configured security policies, network segmentation, encryption key management (KMS/HSM), and continuous compliance controls mapped to industry frameworks (e.g., ISO 27001, SOC 2, NIS2, DORA, FINMA, OSCAL).
* **Observability & Logging:** Unified log aggregation, SIEM integration, centralized audit trails, telemetry pipelines, and standardized health and performance monitoring.
* **Shared Services & Operations:** Baseline operational tooling such as internal DNS resolution, artifact/container registries, secrets management, software-defined storage nodes, and patch management pipelines.

## Key Architectural Approaches

Depending on the stack, hybrid landing zone templates generally take one of three architectural shapes:

| Model | Description | Common Stack / Tooling |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cloud-Native Native Extensions** | Public cloud provider frameworks extended back into private data centers using proprietary edge appliances or managed control planes. | AWS Control Tower + Outposts, Azure Landing Zones + Azure Arc, Google Cloud Anthos |
| **Multi-Cloud IaC Blueprints** | Vendor-neutral Infrastructure-as-Code modules that orchestrate cloud APIs alongside private hypervisors via uniform code bases. | HashiCorp Terraform / OpenTofu modules, Pulumi, Ansible |
| **Declarative Controller / GitOps** | Continuous reconciliation controllers that treat private and public environments as unified, state-driven declarative targets based on a central Source of Truth. | Kubernetes Operators, Crossplane, Custom Configuration Servers / GitOps engines |

The exact structure may evolve as additional resources are introduced. The intention is to keep resources independently understandable and make it straightforward for contributors to add new AWS capabilities.


## Why should you use this module?

* **Accelerated Provisioning:** Eliminates months of manual engineering, allowing new workloads, enterprise tenants, or landing environments to be spun up in minutes.
* **Elimination of Configuration Drift:** Continuous enforcement or version-controlled deployment ensures on-prem and public cloud environments do not deviate from approved baseline standards.
* **Continuous Regulatory Alignment:** Automates auditing and security guardrails directly into the deployment pipeline, ensuring sovereign data and regulatory policies are met by default.
* **Operational Consistency:** Provides platform engineering teams with a single logical target for deploying applications, regardless of where the underlying compute hardware resides.

## Contributing

**Contributions are welcome.**

This project is intended to grow beyond the initial AWS Region resource through contributions from infrastructure engineers, cloud architects and the wider Rescile community.

Useful contributions include:

* New resources
* Resource schema improvements
* Capability coverage
* Dependency definitions
* Validation and testing
* Documentation and examples
* Bug fixes

### Contribution Workflow

1. **Open an issue**: Describe the resource or improvement you would like to contribute.
2. **Discuss the design**: For new resources, agree on the resource model, attributes and dependencies before implementing larger changes.
3. **Fork the repository**: Create your own fork and work in a dedicated branch.
4. **Implement the change**: Follow the existing resource structure and include tests and documentation where appropriate.
5. **Submit a pull request**: Clearly describe what has changed and why.
6. **Review**: Maintainers and community members review the implementation, resource model and compatibility with Rescile UCS.
7. **Merge**: Once approved, the contribution becomes part of the shared module ecosystem.

### Adding a New Resource

A typical contribution should include:

```text
models/
└── aws_<resource>/
    ├── resource.toml
    ├── schema.toml
    └── ...
```

and, where appropriate:

```text
generators/
└── ...

input/
└── ...

output/
└── ...
```

Contributors should avoid introducing provider-specific assumptions where the resource can be expressed through the common Rescile UCS infrastructure model.

* **Design Principles**: The module follows a few basic principles:
* **Declarative**: Resources describe the desired infrastructure state rather than prescribing an imperative sequence of operations.
* **Composable**: Resources should be usable as building blocks for larger infrastructure configurations.
* **Dependency-aware**: Relationships between resources should be explicitly represented so that Rescile UCS can construct and evaluate the resulting infrastructure dependency graph.
* **Cloud-native**: The module should expose AWS capabilities without unnecessarily hiding important AWS-specific configuration.
* **Community-driven**: The resource catalog should evolve based on real-world requirements and contributions from the community.
