This module defines a foundation for resource deployments with rescile UCS. The module provides a standardized building block that lays the ground for provider specific infrastructure modules to construct complete hybrid-cloud environment. It creates and configures a foundation for a managed infrastructure target for subsequent resource deployments.

## Rescile UCS

The module serves as  part of the **Rescile UCS infrastructure ecosystem**. Rescile UCS acts as the provisioning and orchestration environment. It maintains the infrastructure model, resolves dependencies and drives the execution of infrastructure changes. The relationship can be summarized as:

```text
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│         Rescile UCS          │
│                              │
│   Model → Resolve → Deploy   │
└───────────────┬──────────────┘

│                              │
└──────────────────────────────┘
```

UCS provides the common control plane, while individual modules describe the infrastructure resources that can be provisioned. This separation allows modules to remain focused on **what infrastructure should exist**, while UCS manages **how infrastructure is modeled, related and provisioned**.

The exact structure may evolve as additional resources are introduced. The intention is to keep resources independently understandable and make it straightforward for contributors to add new AWS capabilities.

## Contributing

**Contributions are welcome.**

This project is intended to grow beyond the initial AWS Region resource through contributions from infrastructure engineers, cloud architects and the wider Rescile community.

Useful contributions include:

* New resources
* Resource schema improvements
* Capability coverage
* Dependency definitions
* Validation and testing
* Documentation and examples
* Bug fixes

### Contribution Workflow

1. **Open an issue**: Describe the resource or improvement you would like to contribute.
2. **Discuss the design**: For new resources, agree on the resource model, attributes and dependencies before implementing larger changes.
3. **Fork the repository**: Create your own fork and work in a dedicated branch.
4. **Implement the change**: Follow the existing resource structure and include tests and documentation where appropriate.
5. **Submit a pull request**: Clearly describe what has changed and why.
6. **Review**: Maintainers and community members review the implementation, resource model and compatibility with Rescile UCS.
7. **Merge**: Once approved, the contribution becomes part of the shared module ecosystem.

### Adding a New Resource

A typical contribution should include:

```text
models/
└── aws_<resource>/
    ├── resource.toml
    ├── schema.toml
    └── ...
```

and, where appropriate:

```text
generators/
└── ...

input/
└── ...

output/
└── ...
```

Contributors should avoid introducing provider-specific assumptions where the resource can be expressed through the common Rescile UCS infrastructure model.

* **Design Principles**: The module follows a few basic principles:
* **Declarative**: Resources describe the desired infrastructure state rather than prescribing an imperative sequence of operations.
* **Composable**: Resources should be usable as building blocks for larger infrastructure configurations.
* **Dependency-aware**: Relationships between resources should be explicitly represented so that Rescile UCS can construct and evaluate the resulting infrastructure dependency graph.
* **Cloud-native**: The module should expose AWS capabilities without unnecessarily hiding important AWS-specific configuration.
* **Community-driven**: The resource catalog should evolve based on real-world requirements and contributions from the community.
